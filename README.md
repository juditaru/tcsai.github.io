Website for Tilburg Center for Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence

## Adding content

Content can be added to the website by modifying the _config.yml.
The types of content that you might add are:

- Personnel
- Software
- Courses

Until we come up with a more fool proof solution this is the protocol you
follow to add novel content:

1. Pull
2. Create your changes
3. Push

Alternatively, you can make changes directly in the GitHub interface by clicking the [edit icon](https://github.com/tcsai/tcsai.github.io/edit/master/_config.yml).

### Personnel

Please add an introduction about yourself. Example [here](https://github.com/tcsai/tcsai.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml#L66).

### Software

If you have some software that you think would benefit others please share it [here](https://github.com/tcsai/tcsai.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml#L55).

### Courses

Add or modify course descriptions [here]( https://github.com/tcsai/tcsai.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml#L38).
