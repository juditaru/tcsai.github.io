# Tilburg Center for Cognitive Science and Artificial intelligence

We are the coolest cats, we know where its at.

The Sound of Joy is Enlightenment  
Space, Fire, Truth is Enlightenment  
Space Fire  
Sometimes it's Music  
Strange Mathematics  
Rhythmic Equations  
The Sound of Thought is Enlightenment  
The Magic Light of Tomorrow  
Backwards are those of Sadness  
Forward and Onward Are those of Gladness  
Enlightenment Is my Tomorrow  
It has no planes of Sorrow  
Hereby, my Invitation  
I do invite you be of my Space World  
This Song is Sound of Enlightenment  
The Fiery Truth of Enlightenment  
Vibrations come from the Space World  
Is of the Cosmic Starry Dimension  
Enlightenment is my Tomorrow  
It has no planes of Sorrow  
Hereby, our Invitation  
We do invite you to be of our Space World.
